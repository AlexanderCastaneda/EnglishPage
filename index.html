                This website was created with the end of putting in practice the different topics learned along of course of  Englis one.
                <br>
                On help with Olga Andre Pedroza, she is my English teacher and with her help and paciencity I have been to do this website.
                This website will be fed every  three weeks with new topics, in when I will use simply present, simply past and more.
                <br><br> 
                Also it is a funny form to practice and learn English, because I mix English with Web Development. Of course I love  Web Development web.
                <br><br>Enjoy you my little website.
