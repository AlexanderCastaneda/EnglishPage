                Norte de Santander is one of thirty-two departments of Colombia, with its capital in Cúcuta.
                <br><br>Due to its natural resources and its geographic location, it’s a commercial and economic axis of the country, in the same way, it’s known as a big rural production, particularly in the agricultural sector.
                <br>During the precolombina age, the territory of this department was inhabited by people indigenous Chitareros and by Motilones descendants of the Chibchas. They took refuge in the Caribbean mountain range.
                <br><br>With the arrival of some invasives, how Spaniards, the European first in step ground Norte Santandereano was the Aleman Ambrosio Alfinger. He left the Coro with his troops looking for the gold he arrived at área located on the river bank Magdalena, Where maintained a fight with some people indigenous.
                <br>Then Ambrosio Alfinger continued to Giron Satander and traveled from south to north in the Ocaña province but after he was killed by the indigenous people Chimilla nicknamed “Fransisquillo” in the current municipality of Chinacota. Dead Alfinger, Fedro de San Martin took the troup control and with it returned to Coro passing through Cucuta.
                <br><br>In 1541 Hernan Peres de Quezada arrived in Chinacota territory, but had to return in that same year because of indigenous people resistance. Shortly after, Alfonso Perez de Tolosa went out of Tocuyo – Venezuela, and arrived until Salazar de las Palmas passing through Cúcuta, but he also had to return after losing many people in a fight that he lost.
                <br><br>The above is a soft precolombina history of the founding department of Norte Santander but Norte de Santander before was bigger than in actuality because Santander and Norte de Santander were Knew how the Big Santander. So, Between the period of 17 April 1850 and 18 April 1855, The city name was Santander it’s his first name as an admistrative entity and Cúcuta was her capital.
                <br>But in 1857 was created, the Stade Soberano de Santander and his capital was located in Pamplona but in December of the same year was transferred to Bucaramanga city.
                <br><br>However, in a new political división in 1908, Cucuta separated and the department of Cucuta emerged. Again in April of 1910 occurred changes in political división and 34 departments created in 1908 were deleted and the country had a political división of the year 1905, and for this disappered Cucuta how department once again became dependent of Bucaramanga. This was until the creation of the new ley of 1910. Here, on this date was when was born Norte de Santander.

                To the mode of conclusion, I can tell that the present and past simply have many topics for learn but I think with some practice I can be better every day.

                <br>Is important to say that learning English is complicated, yes!! English is harder than math or programming oriented to objects but I enjoy learning English, but I believe I am very bad in English.

                <br><br>Continuing with the conclusion, the tasks of weeks eleven and twelve, it focus on teaching me about simply past, when I have been to learn about your grammatical structure and the regular and irregular verbs important.

                <br><br>Also, the use of the auxiliary "did" and how this helps to create interrogative and negative sentences then I have to tell the importance that is simply past to create and and saying things in the past.

                <br>But it's hard for me and I must practice many times to I be better at English.

                <br><br>Note:
                <br>I decided to put conclusions in this space because I didn't have time to create a new index for adding conclusions, but I promise that in the next I add a conclusions section.
